                LaTeX is a typesetting system that is widely used for writing and publishing scientific documents.
                It allows you to write mathematical symbols and equations. For example, the solution of quadratic equation is defined as: <br>
                <p>
                    When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
                    \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}\]
                </p>
                <br>
                For this webpage, MathJX was used to render LaTeX. The above paragraph was written in plain text as: <br>
                <p>
                When \\(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
                \\[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}\]
                </p>

                <p>
                    As it can be seen, any set of words that we intend to render as LaTeX, has to be enclosed between \\( and \\)
                    The common symbols as alphabets, addition (+), subtraction (-), equal sign (=) are typed as is. While for more complex symbols, abbreviations are used to render the symbols. 
                    These abbreviations are generally intuitive such as for \( \pm \) the equivalent text is \\( \pm \). More of these symbols will be discussed in detail in following sections.
